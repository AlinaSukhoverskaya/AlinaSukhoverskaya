<h3>About Me</h3>
I am a theoretical physicist by education, an engineer by experience, and a data analyst by choice. I like exploring and finding patterns in everything - both in work and in life. I am not afraid of such phrases as RFM analysis, ABC/XYZ analysis, cohort analysis, AB test â€“ just open <a href="https://github.com/AlinaSukhoverskaya/Projects" style="color: red"><b>Projects repository</b></a> up and look for yourself. :paw_prints:
